# Computer networks I assignment 
This is a repository for the source code of the assignment of my university course named after "Computer Networks I". It has two variants, the classic CLI and my improvised GUI version, both written in Java, to comply with the requirements.

## CLI
Completes the required tasks of the assignment automatically. For more details and building instructions, please read the [README](consoleApp/README.md) under _consoleApp_ folder.

## GUI
This one also completes the tasks like above, but this time with real time visual feedback, like camera stream and live graphs. You can find more info, like features and installation instructions in the [README](guiApp/README.md) under the _guiApp_ folder.

## Other notes
### General building and installation info
- Both apps use maven. In order to build them, please make sure you have maven installed and follow the intstruction of the corresponding READMEs mentioned above.
- Both apps were tested with Java 11 and above.
- Of course, in order to build a specific app, make sure you change your current directory to the corresponding app first. For example, to build GUI, change your working folder to _guiApp_.
